## Make LaTeX'ing easier
Do you like talking about math? Do you enjoying communicating with math symbols using the typesetting language LaTeX? Do you want Latex shortcuts in the math server? If you answered yes to all these questions, this repo is designed for you. You can produce compiled latex'd lessons ("factoids", denoted by its shortcut command `\.` before the factoid name) using a simple command of 

`,tex \.cts`

you get

![complete the square](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riemann-discord/math-discord/main/img/cts.png)

Or with 

`,tex \.double cos`

you get

![cosine double angle identities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riemann-discord/math-discord/main/img/double-cos.png)
